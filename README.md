# Parry Hotter & The Wizard of Somerset

## Software Engineering agile game project by Brown Team

You wake to find yourself trapped in a dungeon cell. The (evil) Wizard has had enough of you stealing his market share at the local potions market with your modern new concoctions. He has decided it would be easier to lock you away in his dungeon than to improve his products! You cannot deny, it is a good business plan.

Luckily, the wizard has not used these dungeon cells for years and the hinges of the door are so rusty that they snap with a stern kick. Unfortunately for you, the wizard also has one of his minions down there to keep an eye on you. The moment you break free, you are in a race against time to get out of the dungeon before the minion alerts its master. Your task is to navigate your way out of the dungeon as fast as you can. It will not be easy though as there are numerous monsters in the dungeon that will try to kill you! It's a dramatic adventure......
